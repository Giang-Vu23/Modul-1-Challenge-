MODUL 1 - CHALLENGE: [Tencent – WeChat Pay – Mobile Payments]

[ABSTRACT]
    The field of financial technology (fintech) has witnessed remarkable growth and transformation in recent years. Fintech, which combines finance and technology, can be simply defined as any technological advancement that enhances the experience of financial services for both firms and customers (Howell, 2022). There are six significant segments of fintech, which are: digital payments, online banking, InsurTech, RegTech, cybersecurity, wealth management, and blockchain/ cryptocurrency (Choudhary, 2023). According to Ernst & Young's Global FinTech Adoption Index, the adoption of fintech applications has significantly increased over the years. In 2019, approximately 64% of the global population had used fintech applications, which is a substantial increase from the 15% adoption rate recorded in 2015. Looking ahead, the future of fintech holds immense potential. As technology continues to evolve, fintech is expected to further disrupt traditional financial services, leading to increased efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, and big data analytics are anticipated to play pivotal roles in shaping the future of fintech. In this paper, the author will analyse a specific fintech domain, which is digital payments and its application to WeChat Pay.
