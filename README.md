MODUL 1 - CHALLENGE: [Tencent – WeChat Pay – Mobile Payments]

## ABSTRACT
    The field of financial technology (fintech) has witnessed remarkable growth and transformation in recent years. Fintech, which combines finance and technology, can be simply defined as any technological advancement that enhances the experience of financial services for both firms and customers (Howell, 2022). There are six significant segments of fintech, which are: digital payments, online banking, InsurTech, RegTech, cybersecurity, wealth management, and blockchain/ cryptocurrency (Choudhary, 2023). According to Ernst & Young's Global FinTech Adoption Index, the adoption of fintech applications has significantly increased over the years. In 2019, approximately 64% of the global population had used fintech applications, which is a substantial increase from the 15% adoption rate recorded in 2015. Looking ahead, the future of fintech holds immense potential. As technology continues to evolve, fintech is expected to further disrupt traditional financial services, leading to increased efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, and big data analytics are anticipated to play pivotal roles in shaping the future of fintech. In this paper, the author will analyse a specific fintech domain, which is digital payments and its application to WeChat Pay.

## LANDSCAPE

* [What domain of the financial industry is the company in?]
     Tencent operates in the domain of mobile payments and financial technology (fintech) through its digital payment platform, WeChat Pay. Mobile payment services are a crucial component for the success of mobile e-commerce. They enable users to make payments for goods and services or transfer assets using their mobile devices. Mobile payment refers to the process of conducting financial transactions through a mobile device. According to People's Bank of China (PBOC), there were 275 billion electronic payment transactions in 2021, which increased nearly 17% in compare with 2020.

    The history of mobile oayment in China: In 2018, the majority of payments in China, approximately 83%, were made through mobile payment methods. Unlike many other countries that transitioned from cash to credit cards before adopting mobile payments, China skipped the credit card phase. Credit card usage in China is limited or even non-existent. While mobile payments are growing globally, China stands out with a significantly higher penetration rate. As of 2021, China leads the world in mobile payment adoption, with an overall penetration rate of 87.6% for all forms of mobile payments. Specifically, the penetration rate for mobile payments processed through smartphone applications in China is 40.4% in 2022.

    WeChat offers a range of features including text messaging, voice messaging, broadcast messaging, video conferencing, video games, photo and video sharing, as well as location sharing. It provides users with a diverse set of functionalities to communicate, connect, and engage with others within the app. Details:

This integration has facilitated a seamless transition between online and offline experiences, enhancing user convenience.
    As a successful and influential company in the mobile payments domain, WeChat Pay has been instrumental in shaping these trends and driving the evolution of fintech in the payments industry. Its innovative approach, user-friendly interface, and integration within the WeChat ecosystem have contributed to its success and widespread adoptions.

* [What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?]
    1. Users growth: Maintaining the the amount of users on apps and services and the amount of time that they use engage with the ecosystem. Especially, the company will focus on monthly active users and daily active users. For example, the function of “lucky money” has attracted a lot of users. The concept of giving "red envelopes" - a traditional Chinese practice where money is gifted to family and friends, has also garnered significant user attraction within mobile payment services. WeChat is one of the largest standalone messaging apps globally, with over a billion registered accounts and approximately 700 million active users.
    2. The service accounts also allow to offer direct in-app payment services to users. WeChat expanded its payment services to cover both online and offline purchases. Customers gained the ability to make payments on web pages or in physical stores by scanning QR codes provided by offline retailers. Tencent stated that the decision to open WeChat Pay to businesses occurred earlier than anticipated.
    3. In the domain of mobile payment services, companies like Tencent with WeChat Pay typically use several key metrics to measure success. Some of these metrics include:
        + Transaction volume: This metric measures the total value of transactions processed through the platform. Higher transaction volumes indicate more usage and adoption of the service. Base on CHINA INTERNET WATCH statistics, lots of Mini Apps are avaliable on WeChat to make purchases. In 2019, the volume of e-commerce transactions conducted through WeChat Mini Apps experienced a remarkable surge. The number of transactions increased by 27 times compared to the previous year, which translates to a staggering growth rate of 2700%. Besides, WeChat Pay is not a temporary trend, it has become a significant player in the mobile payment industry. It facilitates an exceptionally large number of daily transactions. Across the various countries where it is accessible, WeChat Pay processes over 1 billion transactions every day (PYMNTS.com). Addtionally, WechatPay is used by more than 800 million people each month (according to statistics of WeChat Pay).
        + Active user base: The number of active users is an important metric that shows the popularity and reach of the platform. Companies aim to increase their user base to expand their market share. According to REUTERS, the Tecent's efforts to develope its e-commerce platform which reached 450 million of the average daily active users in 2021. WeChat Pay enjoys immense popularity, with a user base that rivals its messaging counterpart. While the exact number of users has not been disclosed by WeChat Pay statistics, it is reported that "hundreds of millions" of people utilize the payment app on a daily basis. This indicates a substantial and widespread adoption of WeChat Pay among its users.
        + User engagement: This metric measures how frequently users interact with the platform. Higher engagement levels indicate that users find value in the service and are more likely to continue using it.
        + Merchant adoption: The number of merchants accepting payments through the platform is another important metric. Since its launch in 2013, WeChat Pay initially took some time to gain momentum. However, in 2018, the app experienced significant growth, with usage increasing by approximately 700%. This growth was not limited to China alone; WeChat Pay also expanded its availability to 49 markets outside of China. As a result, the number of merchants accepting WeChat Pay saw a remarkable surge during this period (source: PR Newswire).
        + Revenue and profitability: Ultimately, companies aim to generate revenue and achieve profitability. This metric assesses the financial performance of the company and its ability to sustain and grow the business. In 2021, Tencent generated over USD $87 billion (increase 11% yearly) (souce: Tencent via Macrotrends), and WeChat mini programs generated over $400 billion in annual transactions (increase 70% yearly) (Sources: Tencent, Walk the Chat).
  

* [How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?]
    WeChat Pay serves as WeChat's counterpart to Alipay. It is a mobile payment and digital wallet service seamlessly integrated within the WeChat application. This feature enables users to make quick and convenient payments using their smartphones.
        + Tencent's fight to win mobile payment:  Tencent is aggressively competing to gain control over China's extensive mobile payments market by actively persuading retailers and restaurants to adopt WeChat Pay. However, a recent meeting held in Wuhan revealed challenges faced by Tencent. Restaurant managers voiced complaints about the comparatively high commission fees of WeChat Pay in comparison to its competitor, Alipay. In response, Tencent representatives shifted the focus towards discussing ways in which WeChat Pay could help restaurants reduce other expenses (Osawa, J. 2017).
